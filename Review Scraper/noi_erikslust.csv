Evgenii Selivanov,5 stars,Excellent Italian pizzeria! The pizza itself is top-quality - both the dough and the toppings. The staff and service were incredibly friendly; they even went out of their way to make a pizza that wasn't on the menu. Highly recommended!
Simona Rinaldi,5 stars,I ordered from a home.. Really good and the tomato sauce is phenomenal!
Audun Danielsen,5 stars,"Primarily a takeaway place, but they have a couple of tables if you want to eat in. Amazingly good pizzas! This will be my new go to-place now that I live in the neighbourhood!"

Rikard,5 stars,"The pizzas at this Noi branch are also excellent. I had a Burrata E Parma with a gluten-free base; this gluten-free base tastes and feels like a really good base, in fact one of the better gluten-free pizza bases I've ever tried. It may have been a bit expensive (+40 SEK for the GF base)."
Feisal Mousawi,5 stars,"Always good pizza, can trust these guys. In my opinion it is probably the best in town, can recommend a burrata e parma with a white base."
Steffen Klüver,5 stars,"We were thrilled with the delicious pizza and the friendly staff. A good vegetarian selection, quick preparation—highly recommended!"

Gabriel Westesson,5 stars,"Big difference between this and regular pizza, fast service, got the pizzas in about 5 minutes and well packaged. Was crowded and many there though so they don't get a perfect review"
Harriet Hilbert,5 stars,"My first visit there, a small place with a few seats inside on barstools with ""long tables"" along the windows. I was there with a good friend, who recommended this particular pizzeria. Clean and nice inside, friendly and attentive service. …"
ReXnas,5 stars,"Very good, nice staff. Has a premium feel compared to the usual bachelorette pizza, a little more expensive but much better so much worth the price for me! …"
fanny westrin,5 stars,Terribly good pizza!! Highly recommend we came here by chance and they also served us a whole hour before opening. Fantastic service and fantastic food. Could it be Malmö's best pizza!? …
Kim R,5 stars,"Fantastically good quality pizzas at the same price as the city's ""bad pizzas"". I would choose Noi any day of the week if I had the opportunity to pick up."
Patrik Reic,5 stars,"Awesome Neapolitan pizza with exciting toppings. Superbra does takeaway and in the summer you can sit outside the kiosk and enjoy. However, there is a lack of seating inside."
Rebecka Ödling,5 stars,"Here you will meet nice guys who bake the pizza in an instant. It will be a journey around all the taste zones of the tongue. I arrived there hungry and desperate, I left full and happy …"
Vossjen89,3 stars,"The first time I ordered from there, the Diavola pizza was really good...now it's not on the menu anymore? The Calabrese pizza was sloppy and the bottom kind of fell apart. Maybe Saluhallen is of higher quality? Hope Diavola returns to the menu."
Filip Ranmo,5 stars,"Very good Neapolitan pizza. Soft and easy to digest dough, perfect baking and fine ingredients. Sounds simple but Noi does it in a perfect way and with a service that is 5/5."
Pontus Sterner,5 stars,Best pizza in Malmö (also gluten free). Awesome quality and really doesn't skimp on ingredients. Don't need any other pizza place than this.
