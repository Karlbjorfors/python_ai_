Lacey Redding,5 stars,"Great falafel, crispy! Super fresh veggies and generous customer service :)"
Bengt Liden,4 stars,"We agreed on a ""half special"" , and a ""whole special"" . Went well to take home. There was a perfectly okay range of drinks. Reasonably nice kiosk assistant. There is an ordinary ""door"" order. But also an order over the counter indoors. …"

Emmy Petersson,5 stars,Favoritstället!!
Peter Sevonius,5 stars,"The new owners have taken the food to a whole new level, all homemade bread, sauces etc. Their falafel has to be the best in Malmö. The fact that they are also very friendly is like icing on the cake. Also easy to park close by if you have to drive."
Theo Palm,5 stars,"Was skeptical about the price because I tend to be stingy when I buy falafel. But it was worth every penny. Nice staff who give you a taste and talk to you. The falafel was green and juicy. Freshly baked bread, homemade hummus, fresh salad …"
Mohamed,5 stars,"Very good falafels and everything is good, have tried all the dishes at them. And highly recommend kebabs, falafel and chicken rolls or so plates. Falafel with pomegranate seeds and mint very good. Plenty of kebabs with mixed sauces and …"
Johan Grahm,1 star,When it was newly opened with new owners it was very good. Good freshly made falafel with lots of parsley in freshly baked bread. But something has happened over time. The falafel is not freshly made instead it is very dry and without …
Alice Sellpy,4 stars,I think it is very variable in quality. The first time I ate here I was saved; falafel roll for SEK 45 with both mint and pomegranate seeds. The falafel was nice and green inside. It was incredibly good!! So absolutely incredible! The …
Sam Sam,1 star,"Warning!!! Ordered pizza which was barely edible. I, who never throw away food, had to throw away parts of the dough after I felt the dough clump in my stomach. The dough tasted like plastic and was also sour, reminiscent of DIY pizza dough but worse. Small crumbs of kebab leftovers. Will never eat there again."
MikkyxS,3 stars,"Good sauces and lots of sauce, got like 4 different sauces, the strong one was good with a sting. Good meat that didn't smell or have an off-flavor, fresh salad. 70kr for a kebab roll."
Caroline Lundholm,5 stars,"A very good falafel! Tasty and crispy buns, plenty of fresh vegetables and good sauces. Extra plus for the mint and pomegranate and for the homemade bread! A clear five and among the best I've eaten!"
Amelie A,1 star,Disaster! There are signs with offers they don't have and they stand outside smoking wearing the same clothes they wear when they cook. …
Johan Dennis,2 stars,Good bread and falafel balls even if the bread was not fully baked. Hardly any vegetables and sauce so tasted like half-baked bread.
August Thunblad,5 stars,Very nice staff! He recommended a kebab box which turned out to be an excellent option that I recommend!
Tomas Andersson,5 stars,"At the time of writing, Malmö's best falafel roll. Crispy falafels and an incredibly well-balanced collection of vegetables and sauces in homemade bread. Small details like mint leaves and pomegranate seeds that elevate the roll to five stars and then some. Worth going there just for this."
Murad Alwakaa,5 stars,The best falafel in Malmö. It was very good falafel
Adriana Zonari,5 stars,"What a lift after the change of ownership! Best falafel in Malmö these days. Our own freshly baked bread, fresh vegetables and super tasty falafel with lots of parsley. Recommend!"
Alex Härnqvist,5 stars,"Ate their falafel twice and it is actually Malmö's best!! Super tasty bread and falafel, and fresh vegetables. Nice service and good price :) also have vegan sauces."
Caroline Edgren,4 stars,"Nice to see that they opened with new owners who can make really good rolls! Fresh fine vegetables, good sauces, etc. Seems to be high pressure now after the opening, fun for them, but sad when …"
Andréa,5 stars,"Actually think that the food tastes better after the change of ownership. Even the atmosphere after the renovation has made a big difference for Bellevue kebab & falafel, will order food from here more times."
miccomusik,5 stars,Ordered a falafel from heaven! Such a delicious and fresh salad with super nice sauce. I will come here more often. …
axel nordström,5 stars,Malmö's absolute best falafel! They have a new owner so if you haven't visited the grill in the last 6 months you should do it! He even has freshly baked bread for the falafel that he makes himself!!!
Alexander Pålsson,1 star,Fridge cold falafel and bread. Really traditional

Isabelle Sierra,5 stars,Malmö's best falafel! So fresh and tasty and with a really good combination of different ingredients. A flavor bomb …

Hugo Japon,1 star,"Do not recommend the place. The meat was dry and burnt, the food was bombed with sauce so everything tasted disgusting."
Makio Inose,5 stars,The falafel rolls were the best I've ever had in my life. The owner and his son are also nice guys.
